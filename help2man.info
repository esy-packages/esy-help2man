Overview of `help2man'
**********************

   `help2man' is a tool for automatically generating simple manual
pages from program output.

   Although manual pages are optional for GNU programs other projects,
such as Debian require them (*note Man Pages: (standards)Man Pages.)

   This program is intended to provide an easy way for software authors
to include a manual page in their distribution without having to
maintain that document.

   Given a program which produces reasonably standard `--help' and
`--version' outputs, `help2man' can re-arrange that output into
something which resembles a manual page.

How to Run `help2man'.
**********************

   The format for running the `help2man' program is:

     `help2man' [OPTION]... EXECUTABLE

   `help2man' supports the following options:

`--name STRING'
`-n STRING'
     Use STRING as the description for the `NAME' paragraph of the
     manual page.

     By default (for want of anything better) this paragraph contains
     `manual page for PROGRAM VERSION'.

     This option overrides an include file `[name]' section (*note
     Including text::.).

`--section SECTION'
`-s SECTION'
     Use SECTION as the section for the man page.  The default section
     is 1.

`--include FILE'
`-i FILE'
     Include material from FILE (*note Including text::.).

`--opt-include FILE'
`-I FILE'
     A variant of `--include' for use in Makefile pattern rules which
     does not require FILE to exist.

`--output FILE'
`-o FILE'
     Send output to FILE rather than `stdout'.

`--no-info'
`-N'
     Suppress inclusion of a `SEE ALSO' paragraph directing the reader
     to the Texinfo documentation.

`--help'
`--version'
     Show help or version information.

Including Additional Text in the Output
***************************************

   Additional static text may be included in the generated manual page
by using the `--include' and `--opt-include' options (*note Invoking
help2man::.).

   The format for files included with these option is simple:

     [section]
     text
     
     /pattern/
     text

   Blocks of verbatim *roff text are inserted into the output either at
the start of the given `[section]' (case insensitive), or after a
paragraph matching `/pattern/'.

   Patterns use the Perl regular expression syntax and may be followed
by the `i', `s' or `m' modifiers (*note perlre(1): (*manpages*)perlre.)

   Lines before the first section or pattern which begin with `-' are
processed as options.  Anything else is silently ignored and may be
used for comments, RCS keywords and the like.

   The section output order is:

     NAME
     SYNOPSIS
     DESCRIPTION
     OPTIONS
     EXAMPLES
     *other*
     AUTHOR
     REPORTING BUGS
     COPYRIGHT
     SEE ALSO

   Any `[name]' or `[synopsis]' sections appearing in the include file
will replace what would have automatically been produced (although you
can still override the former with `--name' if required).

   Other sections are prepended to the automatically produced output for
the standard sections given above, or included at *other* (above) in
the order they were encountered in the include file.

Using `help2man' With `make'
****************************

   A suggested use of `help2man' in Makefiles is to have the manual
page depend not on the binary, but on the source file(s) in which the
`--help' and `--version' output are defined.

   This usage allows a manual page to be generated by the maintainer and
included in the distribution without requiring the end-user to have
`help2man' installed.

   An example rule for the program `prog' could be:

     prog.1: $(srcdir)/main.c
             -$(HELP2MAN) --output=$@ --name='an example program' ./prog

   The value of `HELP2MAN' may be set in `configure.in' using either of:

     AM_MISSING_PROG(HELP2MAN, help2man, $missing_dir)

   for `automake', or something like:

     AC_PATH_PROG(HELP2MAN, help2man, false // No help2man //)

   for `autoconf' alone.
